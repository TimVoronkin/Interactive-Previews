This repository contains the source code and documentation for my **Bachelor Thesis** at the University of Pardubice - Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

## 🎓 About the Project

**Interactive Previews** is a modern browser extension designed to increase web browsing efficiency. Instead of constantly clicking links to view images or download PDF files, this extension allows you to instantly preview them by simply hovering your mouse cursor over the link.

### Features
* 🖼️ **Instant Image Previews**: Automatically finds and displays the highest resolution image available using `srcset` and `sizes`. Supports various formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, AVIF, BMP, ICO, TIFF).
* 📄 **Native PDF Rendering**: Integrated `PDF.js` library allows rendering multi-page PDF documents securely without downloading them locally.
* ℹ️ **Customizable Info Bar**: Displays metadata like image dimensions, file size, MIME type, and PDF page counts, with fully configurable visibility and ordering.
* ⚙️ **Granular Control**: 
  * Master toggles to independently enable/disable Image or PDF previews.
  * Smart Triggers: Configure hover delays or require modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt).
  * Enable or disable the extension on specific domains (Blocklist/Allowlist) with full Regular Expression (Regex) support.
* 🚀 **Performance Optimized**: Built with Manifest V3, utilizing Service Workers and asynchronous Fetch API.

### ⚛️ LaTeX Live Preview

The LaTeX source files used to compile this document are located in the `Documentation/LaTeX` directory.

To automatically recompile the PDF on every file save and view it live in [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/):

```bash
cd Documentation/LaTeX
latexmk -pdf -pvc main.tex
```

> `-pvc` (preview continuously) watches for file changes and recompiles automatically. SumatraPDF reloads the PDF in place without locking the file, making it ideal for this workflow. Requires a TeX distribution ([TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)).
